# Block Breaker

Project build on the Unity Game Engine and using C# programming language where I built an scalable game called "Block Breaker" following the guide in the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" created by Ben Tristem, GameDev.tv Team and Rick Davidson.

The Game has 4 scenes: Start Menu, Level 1, Level 2 and Game Over but it can be added more scenes as levels with different blocks positions and different types of blocks.
